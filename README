Running MS2distance programs requires installation of Gurobi and networkx
packages on python 2.7 or later. 

Please follow this link to install networkx:
https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.1/install.html

Please follow this link to install Gurobi:
http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/

*******************************************************************************
The python executable in this directory:

	ms2distance.py: Computes the optimal ms2distance described in the
				   journal article. try ./ms2distance.py -h for help.

	Usage:%s -i inputFile [Options]
	
		-i <string>: Input file containing the initial structure in the first and the target structure in the second line. RNA sequence in line 3 is optional.
					 NOTE: The user is responsible for checking the Watson-Crick compatibility of base paring for the given sequence(if any).  If the given initial and target structures are watson-crick then intermediate structures would satisfy watson-crick, as well. However, the program is not limitted to watson-crick.
		Options:
		
		-pk  			Allow formation of psuedoknots
		-nopt			Near-optimal algorithm
		-o <string>	 	Prefix for the output names. Defualt is the input prefix.
		-k <int> 		Threshold for locality of shift moves
		-h  			Print help
		
		output:	
				1) MS2 path is printed in the standard output.
				2) dot file of the conflict digraph
					   
Example:
	./ms2distance.py -i Lcollosoma.in -o Lcollosoma > Lcollosoma.path
